# MaTREEd

MaTREEd is a Tree Information System for Madrid neighborhoods, submitted for the [GREEMTA challenge](https://challenge.greemta.eu/) in December 2020.

MaTREEd makes use of the datasets of Madrid trees and neighborhoods to assess the current tree carbon stock and annual sequestration rate for each neighborhood. It also offers a simulator to evaluate the impact of user-defined tree-planting scenarios.

The submission consists of:

* a [project description](https://github.com/GISdevio/MaTREEd/blob/main/project-description.md), which includes the full presentation and description of the work;
* a [Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GISdevio/MaTREEd/main) to interactively run the data processing code on the web;
* a map-based [web application](https://gisdevio.github.io/MaTREEd/#/), which visualizes the results of the processing and allows users to run simulations.
